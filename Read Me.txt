
Hi, 

Thanks for taking the time to take a look at this project. 

Here is a brief summary of what was achieved : 

- 6 RSS feeds pulled onto the page and customized accordingly using rss2json API 
- The ability to hide and show feeds using checklist buttons
- The ability to hide feeds using the pink 'x' button 
- The ability to then restore all feeds 
- The ability to add one new feed 
- The ability to filter the feeds on the page
- Tried to mimic as much as possible the style of the original .pds file for the task
- For small and medium screens, a much more limited functionality, but displays properly on page

Thanks again, 

Kind regards, 

Michael
